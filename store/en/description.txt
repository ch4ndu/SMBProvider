PLEASE NOTICE: This app is not yet feature-complete and is currently only able to read files, neither to modify them nor to create new ones. Please do not rate this app badly beacause of this fact.
I'm currently working on this. You can keep track of my development on Github (see below).

This app uses the new storage access framework introduced with Android 4.4 KitKat to give you access to files on SMB shares (aka Windows Shares).
By means of a system dialog, every app can let you open files from there. In the future, you will also be able to directly edit them or create new files.

The sources of this app are released under the GPLv3 and can be visited at https://github.com/hahnjo/SMBProvider. Feel free to fork and edit / translate it. Don't fotget to send me pull requests!
